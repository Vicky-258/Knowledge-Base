# **WEEK 1: Docker Fundamentals + ML App Containerization**

### Weekly Goal:

By the end of Week 1, I should be able to:

- Understand how containers work
    
- Write Dockerfiles
    
- Build + run images
    
- Containerize a simple FastAPI ML model
    

###  Daily-Style Nudges:

- ~~**Day 1:** Install Docker + run hello-world container
    
- ~~**Day 2:** Understand images, layers, containers
    
- ~~**Day 3:** Write your first Dockerfile for a simple Python script
    
- ~~**Day 4:** Containerize a basic FastAPI “hello” app
    
- ~~**Day 5:** Add a simple ML model (sklearn) into FastAPI
    
- ~~**Day 6:** Build → tag → run → publish image to DockerHub
    
- ~~**Day 7:** Mini project: Deploy image on your system as a service
