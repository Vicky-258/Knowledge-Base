## Thoughts:

- Sliding window can be used to compute any sequence of overlapping elements in an array.
- It can be implemented with a left and a right pointer.
- There can be two types of sliding windows 
- One with fixed size if you have an idea on what will be the size of all the substring
- Two with a variable size it can be used when you need to have subarray with any length.
