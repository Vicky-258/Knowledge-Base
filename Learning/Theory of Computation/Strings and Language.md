## Topic 📖: Strings and Language

## Key Concepts 🔑:

- Strings : set of characters. Ex: “Apple”, “001”, “😁”, “”
- Languages : Languages are set of strings.
    - They typically act as sets with union and intersection operations.
    - Other operations are concatenation and Kleene Star
        - Concatenation — A.B: Add each string in B to the end of each string in A (Think of Cartesian product 'x').
        - Kleene Star: Set of string where the strings are concatenated with all the strings in the set (including them) zero or more times. (Since it is zero or more times this set contains "" string too).
        - Ex: A = {Orange, Mango} => A* = {"", Orange, Mango, OrangeMango, OrangeOrange, MangoOrange, MangoMango, .....}
