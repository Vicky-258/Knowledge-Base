#DBMS [[03-10-2025]]

- The index fragmentation happens when the data is scattered across multiple pages of a disk.
    - pages: A fixed amount of continuous space in a disk which will be loaded as a whole into memory.

- This happens when a random value without any order happens to enter the tree.

- These random values when passed onto a tree gets balanced which may cause the page to split which results in empty space on both pages which we can't be sure to get filled because of random filling.
