Scaling refers to the process making your system bigger and better to handle any amount of load you are expecting to have and even more if the system goes like an Overnight victory.

There are mainly two types of scaling:

- Vertical Scaling

    Its like if your system can't handle the load just make it stronger for a server it maybe like buying CPUs, RAMs, SSDs.

    This may melt your money more than a lava bucket melting things but even if you are a multi-billionaire every hardware can only be boosted to come extent.

- Horizontal Scaling

    It's like increasing the man-power to finish a task.

    Instead of supercharging your existing machine you are gonna buy a second one to work with the existing one.


### Components to consider while scaling:

#### Load balancer

- Its like the traffic police that routes the traffic for separate lanes based on the traffic.
- It balances the load on different servers on the horizontal scaling and routes based on the traffic it mostly has a separate IP for it that shows to the public and communicate with servers having private IP.
#### DataBases

- Uses sharding or partitioning to separate the same database into multiple machines each containing a part of the DB.
### Principles of System Design:
