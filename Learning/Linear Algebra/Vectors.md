## Topic 📖: Vectors

## Key Concepts 🔑:

There are three ways to visualize vectors:
- **Physics way** — Just representing the vectors as arrows in space with direction and length

- **CS way** -  Representing the vectors as list of number with equal number of values as the dimensions, each representing a value in a dimension.

- **Mathematical way** — Just treating them as number that can be added with one another and multiplied with a single digit (scalar).


## My Insights 🔭:

- Physics way — vectors need not be aligned with origin they can be moved around anywhere.

- CS way — They just represent them as list $$
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
    where the first element shows x-axis and second element represent y-axis.
