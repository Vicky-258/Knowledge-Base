## Topic 📖: Spans, Linear combinations, basis


## Key Concepts 🔑:

- Span: The set of all vectors you get when you scale two basis vectors.
- Basis: The set of vectors that when scaled gives you the span of the total vector space.
- Linearly Dependent: If a vector is equal or say lay on top of another vector in 2-d space and if the third vector happens to be in the span of the other two vectors say 
$$
\vec{w} = \vec{u} + \vec{v}$$
    then it is said to be linearly dependent
- Linearly independent: If all the vectors involved doesn't fall in any other's linear space or any two's span then they are said to be linearly independent.
## My Insights 🔭:

- The span we get when we use two basis vectors without them laying on one another will be total space if it is a 2-dimensional space and a 2-d sheet if it is a 3-dimensional space.
- If there are three vectors and all of them are linearly independent then it will cover the whole 3-d space.
- I just studied it in math to prove if they are dependent or not but didn't understood what is it until now
- Realization after completion: 
    Both 
 $$
\begin{aligned}
\text{The vectors } \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \text{ are independent if the equation:} \\
a\mathbf{u} + b\mathbf{v} + c\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}, \\
\text{has only the trivial solution: } a = b = c = 0.
\end{aligned}
$$
    and 
    $$
\vec{w} \neq \vec{u} + \vec{v}$$
    same
    let me explain the first says "Three vectors are independent when they only meet when all their scalar values are 0". This means they only meet when all of them are in the starting point (likely origin in most cases). This clearly explain that they won't interfere one another in their respective linear path or span.
