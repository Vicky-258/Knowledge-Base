**Barometric pressure** is an _ancient mariner’s tool_ for weather prediction. And yes — it still works! 🧙‍♂️⛵

#### 🌪️ Rule of Thumb:

|Pressure Trend|Meaning|
|---|---|
|📉 Rapid Drop (5–10 hPa in 3 hrs)|Storm likely approaching|
|📈 Rapid Rise|Improving weather|
|🟰 Steady Pressure|No major change|
|🐢 Slow Drop|Possible rain, mild storm|
|🐢 Slow Rise|Gradual clearing up|
