# 📌 MindLens — Week 1 Task Board
Goal of the week → Load dataset → Clean → Train 2 baselines → Compare → Document

---

## ✅ Status Legend
- [ ] Not started
- [/] In progress
- [x] Completed

---

## 📅 Day 1 — Dataset Setup
- [x] Download Propaganda dataset (SemEval / NLP4IF)
- [x] Create project folders (data/raw, data/processed, notebooks, src)
- [x] Place dataset into `data/raw/`
- [x] Inspect dataset in a notebook (columns, labeling, distribution)

---

## 📅 Day 2 — Light Data Cleaning
- [x] Text cleaning (lowercase, remove URLs/HTML, normalize spaces)
- [x] Label cleaning
- [x] Save cleaned dataset into `data/processed/`

---

## 📅 Day 3 — Baseline Model #1 (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- [ ] Vectorize text using TF-IDF
- [ ] Train logistic regression classifier
- [ ] Evaluate performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- [ ] Export confusion matrix

---

## 📅 Day 4 — Baseline Model #2 (DistilBERT)
- [ ] Tokenize dataset using HF tokenizer
- [ ] Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset
- [ ] Evaluate using same metrics as Day 3
- [ ] Save results screenshot or table

---

## 📅 Day 5 — Comparison & Insights
- [ ] Compare results of Model 1 vs Model 2
- [ ] Analyze 3 types of errors:
  - confident wrong
  - confused predictions
  - borderline cases
- [ ] Write insights in a notebook or NOTES.md

---

## 📅 Day 6 — Documentation Day
- [ ] Update README.md with:
  - project summary
  - dataset source
  - baseline results table
  - folder structure
- [ ] Add confusion matrix / results images (optional but good)

---

## 📅 Day 7 — Reflection (No Code Day)
- [ ] Review insights and failure patterns
- [ ] Brainstorm targeted new dataset samples for Week 2
- [ ] Chill (mandatory 🙂)

---

### 🏁 End-of-Week Checklist
- [ ] Both baselines executed and recorded
- [ ] README updated
- [ ] NOTES.md (or notebook) includes error patterns and ideas
- [ ] No burnout 🤝
