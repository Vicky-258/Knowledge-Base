### 🔥 1. **Clickbait Detection**

- 🔍 NLP papers on clickbait classification
    
- 🧠 Look for:
    
    - Common features used (word patterns, sentence structure)
        
    - Datasets (e.g., _Clickbait Challenge 2017_, Webis Clickbait Corpus)
        
    - Light ML models that worked well

### 🔥 3. **Bias / Framing Detection**

- Look at:
    
    - News bias datasets (e.g., _Media Bias Corpus_)
        
    - Linguistic cues used in framing bias

### 🔥 4. **Statistical Manipulation & Source Vagueness**

- 🧪 This is more heuristic than ML-heavy
    
- We’ll check:
    
    - Regex tricks
        
    - Keyword-based flagging
        
    - If any academic work exists on “source credibility” detection
