### 📘 Week 1 (Oct 29 – Nov 3)

**Focus:** Getting hooked

- _Atomic Habits_: Read Chapters 1–4 (~70 pages) — these cover identity, small habits, and cues.
    
- _Astrophysics_: Read first 2 chapters — "The Greatest Story Ever Told" & "On Earth as in the Heavens."  
    🧠 _Goal:_ Just get familiar with both books’ tones. Don’t force retention. Let curiosity kick in.
